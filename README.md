# BuzzApiSample-Node

A TypeScript sample and reusable client library for the Buzz API. The `BuzzApiClient` class
handles OAuth 2.0 authentication, automatic token refresh, exponential backoff, and throttling
(rate limits and backend pressure) so your integration code can focus on business logic.

Targets **Node.js 22+** and uses only built-ins (`fetch`, `node:crypto`) — **no runtime
dependencies**. TypeScript is a build-time dev dependency only.

## Authentication

The only authentication method supported by the client is **OAuth 2.0 JWT Client Credentials**
([RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749) +
[RFC 7523](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523)).
An RSA private key signs a short-lived JWT assertion; Buzz verifies the signature against the
registered public key and returns a Bearer access token valid for one hour. The private key
never leaves your system — there is no shared secret to intercept.

> The legacy username/password (`login3`) flow is **not** used by new integrations and is not
> part of this client. It appears only inside the setup/cleanup scripts, where an administrator
> must briefly authenticate to create the Application Identity account and register keys.

## Overview

**`sample.ts`** demonstrates read-only access:
1. Configuring `BuzzApiClient` with OAuth credentials and a Buzz server URL.
2. Calling `getuser2` to verify authentication and discover the home domain.
3. Calling `getdomain2` to read domain details.

The sample is intentionally read-only — it can be run repeatedly without modifying any data.

**BuzzApiClient** simplifies integration by:
- Managing OAuth tokens automatically — requesting and refreshing Bearer tokens as needed.
- Retrying transient failures with exponential backoff (1 s → 64 s, up to 5 retries).
- Handling throttling (rate limits, time limits, backend pressure) — see [Throttling and backend pressure](#throttling-and-backend-pressure).
- Providing `jsonRequest` and `verifyResponse` helpers for common JSON API patterns.

### Throttling and backend pressure

Most Buzz API commands report errors, throttles included, as **HTTP 200** with a code in the
XML/JSON response envelope (`response.code`). REST-style endpoints use real HTTP status codes.
`BuzzApiClient` handles both, so it keeps working as commands move to REST conventions:

- **Detection** — a request counts as throttled if the HTTP status is 429 or 503, *or* the envelope
  code is one of `TimeLimit`, `RateLimit`, `BackendPressure`, `ServerOverwhelmed`, `RetryLater`,
  `LimitExceeded`, `TooManyRequests`, or `Service Unavailable` / `ServiceUnavailable` (sent when the
  server sheds load before authentication). XML responses are parsed as well as JSON, using a small
  built-in converter (no XML dependency).
- **How long to wait** — `Retry-After` (sent even with HTTP 200), then `X-RateLimit-Reset`
  (seconds until the window resets), then exponential backoff with jitter. The client waits as long
  as the server asks, up to 10 minutes. If the server asks for longer, the request fails straight away
  rather than retrying early, because an early retry counts against the limit again.
- **Client-wide back-off** — once the server throttles one request, every request on that
  `BuzzApiClient` instance waits out the same window.
- **Batch and multi-object commands** — the outer code can be `OK` while individual items are
  throttled. `verifyResponse` then throws `BuzzApiThrottledError` with `throttledItemIndexes`,
  so you can resubmit just those items. The full response is in `response`.
- **Retries used up** — `jsonRequest` throws `BuzzApiThrottledError`, which extends
  `BuzzApiError`. Its `status` is 429 or 503 even when the server sent HTTP 200.
  `code` and `retryAfterMs` are also set.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 22 or newer** (for stable global `fetch`).
- Install dev dependencies (TypeScript) and build once:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Compatibility

Written for **Node.js 22 LTS** (the oldest maintained LTS line) and verified to run on the
current release (Node 24). The client uses only stable built-ins, and the package has **zero
runtime dependencies**, so newer Node versions work without changes. Nothing here discourages
running on the latest Node.

## Configuration

Configuration uses **environment variables** (12-factor style). For local development you can put
them in a `.env` file in the project root — it is loaded automatically and is gitignored.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BUZZ_SERVER_URL` | Buzz API server URL (no trailing slash) |
| `BUZZ_CONTACT_INFORMATION` | Contact info for the User-Agent header |
| `BUZZ_APPLICATION_INFORMATION` | Application name for the User-Agent header |
| `BUZZ_OAUTH_USER_ID` | `userid` of the Application Identity account (the OAuth `client_id`) |
| `BUZZ_OAUTH_KID` | Key id (`kid`) chosen when registering the public key |
| `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` | Path to the RSA private key PEM |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in, or let the setup script generate it.

---

## Quickest start

### Run (setup + demo in one command)

The run script checks whether one-time setup has been completed. If not, it runs the interactive
setup first, then builds and executes the read-only demo.

```bash
node scripts/run-buzz-sample.js
node scripts/run-buzz-sample.js --setup    # force re-running setup
```

### Cleanup (return to a clean state)

Deletes the Application Identity account from Buzz, removes the registered OAuth key, and deletes
the local key files and `.env`.

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-buzz-sample.js
```

---

## OAuth setup (one time per application)

The setup script automates all of the following, but you can also perform the steps manually.

### Step 1 — Create an Application Identity account

An Application Identity account authenticates exclusively via OAuth. Create it with the
`createusers2` API and `type=applicationidentity`, using an admin account with the Create User
right in the target domain. Record the returned `userid` — this is your **OAuth User ID**
(`BUZZ_OAUTH_USER_ID`), used as the OAuth `client_id`.

### Step 2 — Generate an RSA key pair

```bash
node scripts/new-buzz-oauth-key.js                 # writes private_key.pem + public_key.pem
node scripts/new-buzz-oauth-key.js --out secrets --bits 4096
```

Choose a **Key ID** (`kid`), e.g. `2025-q2`. Allowed characters: ASCII letters, digits, `-`, `_`,
`.` (max 128).

> **SECURITY** — `private_key.pem` is gitignored. Store it in a secrets manager for production.
> Never commit it.

### Step 3 — Register the public key with Buzz

```bash
node scripts/register-buzz-oauth-key.js \
    -s https://backgroundapi.agilixbuzz.com \
    -u 12345678 \
    -k 2025-q2 \
    -p public_key.pem
# Admin Bearer token via -t, the BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN env var, or an interactive prompt.
```

A `204 No Content` response means the key is stored.

### Step 4 — Configure and run

Create `.env` (see Configuration above) or run `node scripts/run-buzz-sample.js`, then:

```bash
npm run build && npm run sample
```

---

## Using BuzzApiClient in your own code

```ts
import { BuzzApiClient } from 'buzz-api-sample'; // or './dist'

const client = BuzzApiClient.fromPemFile(
  'https://backgroundapi.agilixbuzz.com',
  'MyApp/1.0 (Node; MyApp; admin@example.com)',
  '12345678',        // oauthUserId
  '2025-q2',         // oauthKid
  'private_key.pem', // privateKeyPath
);

// BuzzApiClient obtains and refreshes Bearer tokens automatically.
const user = client.verifyResponse(await client.jsonRequest('GET', 'getuser2'));
const domain = client.verifyResponse(
  await client.jsonRequest('GET', 'getdomain2', { domainid: '6' }),
);
```

`jsonRequest(method, cmd?, params?, jsonBody?, includeToken?)` resolves to the parsed JSON
response. `verifyResponse(node)` throws `BuzzApiError` unless `response.code === "OK"` (and
recursively checks child responses from multi-object commands such as CreateUsers2). Throttles
raise `BuzzApiThrottledError`, a subclass of `BuzzApiError`.

## Key management

### Rotating a key (zero downtime)

1. Generate a new key pair and choose a new `kid`.
2. Register the new public key (PUTting a new `kid` leaves the old key active).
3. Update `BUZZ_OAUTH_KID` and `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` to the new key.
4. Once all instances have switched over, delete the old key:
   `DELETE {server}/api/users/{userid}/keys/{old-kid}` with an admin Bearer token.

### Revoking a compromised key

Register a new key, switch your app to it, then delete the compromised public key and revoke
outstanding tokens (`POST {server}/api/oauth/revoke` with form body `token=<access_token>`).

## Troubleshooting OAuth

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `invalid_client: The client_assertion JWT has expired.` | Clock skew or a slow retry. | Sync your system clock (NTP). A fresh JWT is built for every token request. |
| `invalid_client: No active key found for the specified 'kid'.` | `BUZZ_OAUTH_KID` doesn't match a registered key. | Re-register the key and verify the `kid` matches exactly. |
| `invalid_client: ... signature or claims are invalid.` | Wrong private key, or `iss`/`sub` mismatch. | Confirm `BUZZ_OAUTH_USER_ID` is the Application Identity account's `userid` and the key matches the registered public key. |
| HTTP 400 registering a key | Wrong PEM format or key too small. | Use an SPKI PEM (`-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`), minimum 2048 bits. |
| HTTP 401/403 registering a key | Admin token lacks Update User rights. | Use an admin with the Update User right on the account. |

## Multi-factor authentication

MFA affects only the **administrator login** that `node scripts/setup-buzz-oauth.js` and `node scripts/cleanup-buzz-sample.js` use to
create the Application Identity account and register its key. It does **not** affect the
sample or your integration.

An [Application Identity account](https://api.agilixbuzz.com/docs/entry/Concept/OAuth.md)
authenticates with a signed JWT assertion instead of a password, and cannot be logged into
interactively at all. The API reference makes the consequence explicit: OAuth *"works in
domains where MFA is required for administrative accounts, since it authenticates via
signed JWT assertions rather than a username and
password"* ([Login3](https://api.agilixbuzz.com/docs/entry/Command/Login3.md)). So an
integration built on this sample keeps running unattended in a domain that requires MFA of
every administrator — which is a large part of why OAuth is preferred over the legacy
`login3` flow.

### What the setup script does

When the admin account has a second factor configured,
[`login3`](https://api.agilixbuzz.com/docs/entry/Command/Login3.md) answers
`SecondFactorRequired` and returns a short-lived token. The script prompts for the
one-time code and presents both to
[`secondfactorauthenticate`](https://api.agilixbuzz.com/docs/entry/Command/SecondFactorAuthenticate.md),
which returns the real session token. That short-lived token is sent in an
`Authorization: Bearer` header — it is ignored if placed in the request body.

### Running unattended

Every prompt falls back to an environment variable, including the one-time code:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BUZZ_ADMIN_USERNAME` | Admin login, as `userspace/username` |
| `BUZZ_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin password |
| `BUZZ_ADMIN_MFA` | One-time code, when the account has MFA |

A TOTP code is valid for about 30 seconds, so `BUZZ_ADMIN_MFA` only helps where something
can generate a current code at run time (a CI secret store, or a TOTP library seeded with
the shared secret). For a one-off run, leave it unset and type the code when prompted.

Note that this applies to *setup* only. Once setup has written the configuration, the
sample authenticates via OAuth and needs no human involvement of any kind.

### Troubleshooting the setup login

| Code shown by the setup script | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `SecondFactorRequired` | The password was correct and the account has MFA enabled. | Expected — the script prompts for the one-time code and completes the login. |
| `SecondFactorConfigurationNowRequired` | The domain's password policy now requires MFA, but this account has not configured it. | Sign in to Buzz with the account, finish MFA setup, then re-run. |
| `InvalidCredentials` | Wrong username or password. | The username must be `userspace/username`, e.g. `myschool/admin`. |
| `AccountLockout` | Too many failed password attempts. | An administrator must unlock the account. |
| `PasswordExpired` | The password expired under the domain's password policy. | Change the password in Buzz, then re-run. |
| `LoginMethodNotAllowed` | The account does not permit password login (SSO-only, for example). | Use a different admin account for setup. |
